#  Overview
This repository contains a collection of scripts written in Python, PowerShell, Terraform e.g.
These scripts cover a wide range of topics and can be used as references or templates for building your own projects.
 <br/><br/>
## Installation
To use these scripts, you'll need to have the following tools installed:
* Python
* PowerShell
* Terraform
* Visual Studio Code
Once you have these tools installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/jellebee/guides.git
```
## Usage
Each script is self-contained and can be run independently. Simply navigate to the directory containing the script you want to run and execute it using the appropriate command:
For python you could use
```
python my_script.py
```
For Powershell you could use
```
powershell.exe -File my_script.ps1
```
Most scripts require modification, so whether you use Python, Powershell or Terraform I would recommend using Visual Studio Code.
