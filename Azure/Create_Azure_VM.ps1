Hi Guys, I made a small script for creating a VM from PS. I will also add an AZCLI file up later. 
You can use it freely, wherever necessary. 

From the azure portal Ã¬n the right top you have a way to click on the Powershell icon (cloudshell) and press powershell. From here you could run the script below directly
Please check the script for connecting to Azure in the Azure GIT repo. O365 will be added later.

$local = Read-Host -Prompt "Are you running the script locally? Say 'yes' or 'y' elsewise AZ connection will not be established."
if ($local -eq "yes" -or $local -eq "y")
{
	#Before doing anything, importing the module and connecting to Azure
	Import-Module -Name Az
	Connect-AzAccount
}

    #Just to double check that you would like to continue
    $areyousure = Read-host -Prompt "Are you sure you would like to continue? [y/n]"
