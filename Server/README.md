In this read me I will shortly describe some of the more common script in the root of this directory:
Get-Childitem - Used to obtain a list of all files and directories in the current directory including all subitems
RoboCopy - Used for copying between network drives or shares
Windows_Auto_Logon_Script - Used for configuring the auto login option within Windows
Fileshares_Export - Exports a list of SMB shares on the current machine (server). Including ACL's from all child items.
